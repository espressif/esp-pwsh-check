# Contributing and Development

We welcome contributions! To contribute to this repository, please follow these steps:

## Code and Testing

- **Code Style and Structure:**

- **Pre-Commit Hooks:** Install pre-commit hooks in this repository using the `pre-commit install` command.

- **Readable Code Structure:** Structure your code in a readable manner. The main logic should be in the default rule function, with implementation details in helper functions. Avoid nested `if` statements and unnecessary `else` statements to maintain code clarity and simplicity.

- **Remove Debug Statements:** Remove any development debug statements from your files.


## Documentation and Maintenance
